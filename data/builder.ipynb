    "#### Data Processing and Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up the necessary libraries and functions to process raw basketball game data and generate a structured dataset. The dataset will be created by merging two CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Schedule File** (`schedule.csv`): Contains information about games, including dates, home and away teams, and the winning team.\n",
    "2. **Game Logs File** (`gamelogs.csv`): Stores detailed statistical data for each game, broken down by team.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Components:\n",
    "- **Library Imports**: We use `csv` for handling CSV files, `os` for file path manipulations, and `rich` for enhanced console output with progress tracking.\n",
    "- **File Path Handling**: We determine the absolute paths of the input files to ensure proper loading regardless of the working directory.\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: The `create_dataset` function:\n",
    "  - Reads the schedule and game log data.\n",
    "  - Uses a dictionary (`defaultdict`) for efficient lookups of team statistics by date.\n",
    "  - Iterates through scheduled games, retrieving corresponding statistics from the game logs.\n",
    "  - Merges relevant data into a structured format and writes it to `dataset.csv`.\n",
    "  - Utilizes a progress bar to track processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running this section, you will generate a cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis or machine learning applications."
